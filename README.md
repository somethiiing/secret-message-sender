# Secret Message Sender

Allows users to create encrypted messages using a random passphrase. Also can decrypt the messages. Allows for expiration dates for the messages; if expired, it will not give a message. In addition, if given an undecryptable message or incorrect passphrase, will show error message. Passphrases can be passed in by # in the URL.
